# About Me
Hi, I'm Robert Jenner, a Software Engineering student at Sheffield Hallam University currently on my placement year.

Every project I make I try to not only expand my knowledge on the tools I'm using, but implement entirely new technologies to keep honing my skills.

I'm passionate about creating apps that make understanding and tracking hobbies a fun and engaging activity, as well as optimising the flow of tasks. I have made theme park and music trackers that I use day to day and am always looking to improve on them.
